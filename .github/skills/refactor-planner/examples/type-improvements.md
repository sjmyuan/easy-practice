# Type Improvements Example

## Objective
Add strict type annotations to utility functions

## Refactoring Plan

### Steps (Adapted TDD - Focus on type-checking)
- Step 1: Validate Baseline
- Step 2: Add type annotations to utils.ts functions
- Step 3: Verify existing tests still pass
- Step 4: Run type-checker and fix any issues
- Step 5: Validate Quality

### Notes
This example demonstrates an adapted TDD approach where the focus is on type-checking validation rather than following the full test-first cycle. This is appropriate for type improvements where existing tests provide adequate coverage.
